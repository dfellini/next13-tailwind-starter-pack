# Next.js 13 + Tailwind CSS 3.2 - Starter Pack

## About

This is a starter project based off of the example project over on [github](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-tailwindcss), generously provided by the [Vercel](https://vercel.com) team. I've added a few bits and bobs to make it more useful for my own purposes, and for learning.

## How to use

Clone this project down to your machine. Open up the project in your favorite editor, and run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

It'll start up a server on `localhost:3000` and you'll be able to see your changes in real time.

## Opinionated?

Yes. It's set up how I like to run things. But do it your way. It's just a starting point.

## NO warranty or anything of that sort

This is a personal project, and I'm not responsible for anything that happens to your machine, your data, or anything else. Use at your own risk. This isn't meant for production. It's just a launching point for testing out Next.js 13 and Tailwind CSS 3.2.
